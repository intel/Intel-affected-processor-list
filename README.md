## End of Servicing Lifetime
Processors that have met the End-of-Servicing-Lifetime (EOSL) milestone may not be listed in the table and mitigation status of EOSL processors may not be evaluated. More information on processor servicing changes may be found in this help article https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000022396/processors.html. Some processors may have extended servicing, which is servicing provided after broad market servicing concludes.  Extended servicing is available to customers who have extended servicing agreements with Intel. Intel does not have extended servicing for all processors. For customers interested in extended servicing, please contact your Intel representative.
